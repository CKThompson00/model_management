# Model Management
Model Management Repo for Azure AI Models

This repo contains a Python notebook that demonstrates how to leverage the regional APIs to pull down the model deprecation information for all models in Azure AI Foundry.

You can write this to a SQL DB for now.  Other platforms to come soon.

## Future
- Will be adding a UI and creating automation around this
- Converting it to use all Entra ID Auth
- Converting from pyodbc to the new Microsoft native Python ODBC driver
